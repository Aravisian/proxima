Gedit users may want to use
gsettings set org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor highlight-current-line false
to make highlited lines readable.

FIREFOX (and other browsers): To fix close, min, max buttons from appearing shrunkedn and no titlebars- click the hamburger icon on far top right.
Then click "Customize Toolbar." A window will open. On the very far left bottom is a checkbox "Titlebar". Check that to "On".

Proxima applies credit to NUCLEO and APB for inspiration of the design of the center Title portion design of the theme.

Installation:
Extract "Proxima.tar.gz" to your /usr/share/themes folder or to ~/.themes
Apply through your settings, appearance or window manager settings.
For Mate, Cinnamon, XFCE4 Desktops.
Cinnamenu; Stark Menu; Whiskermenu:
Right click the menu icon and select properties or configure. Under appearance, select custom icon. Navigate to .../themes/Proxima/cinnamon/mint-menu-icon.png. XFCE 4.16 - Youc can select "No Icon" in whiskermenu, instead.
Select this as your icon - it will act as the 'transparency' to overlay the Menu Icon Button.
XFCE4 - WhiskerMenu users MAY experience a #474747 border around the icon. To resolve if this happens; Open your Panel Settings > Appearance and select the Panel.png from /themes/Proxima/whiskermenutheme as the background on the panel instead of using the system panel.

To disable overlay scrollbars:
sudo nano /etc/environment
Add the following line:
GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0
Hit ctrl+x to exit, hit the Y key to say yes to save, then hit the Enter key to save under current configuration.

Alternatively, to disable overlay scrollbars only per specific application:
In terminal run (In this example Gedit- change the app name as needed)
GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0 gedit

OR in terminl run (Non-XFCE4 D.E.'s)
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
