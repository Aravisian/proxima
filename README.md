Proxima-GTK-theme

Credit to APB and Nucleo for inspiration in design of the Titlebar appearance (Alien Mind 2).
Credit to J. J. Ying for inspiration on the titlebutton design (close, min, max buttons) as I sought a deep 3D button design that stylized in the same manner as Azenis 2 does.

Credit to myself for shamelessly stealing from my Dashboard theme for the dark green insets.


Proxima

Alien appearance with cyan backing. This is actually a bit of Rebellion on my part. Many of my latest gtk themes have been more toned down as I study .css. However, I needed to break free of that and go a bit more eye candy, over the top, no holds barred. I needed to just be me for this one.
Set alien stylized "writing" throughout. If any of you reading this who are already familiar with my style are wondering if these contain a hidden code and mathematical meaning:
They don't. Ain't got time for that.

In XFWM4 - this Does Contain the Shade button or Rollup button. I included a Sample for Viewing in the Lower Right of the screenshot above. In the XFWM4 themerc, this is disabled by default. To enable it, open the themerc file in /proxima/xfwm4/ and change the line "button_layout=O|HMC" to "button_layout=O|SHMC"
Inactive (Darkened) and Active (lighted) borders.


This is for Cinnamon and XFCE.

Currently, my time is limited as I have become ridiculously busy with work; I have not yet adapted this to Mate Desktop. I may try to do it at a future date (If you want it, Mate D.E. users, please speak up...)
